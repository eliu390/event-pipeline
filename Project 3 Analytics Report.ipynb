    "## Data Pipeline Files, Components and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The data pipe for this project consisted of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Files\n",
    "- `docker-compose.yml`: details about the docker containers and environments that are needed to set-up and run the entire data pipeline.\n",
    "- `stream` directory: stores the files used to stream, filter, and write to hive. \n",
    "    - `[action].py` files: sets up the [action]'s spark streaming job.\n",
    "    - `template.py`: template file used to facilitate the setup of spark jobs.\n",
    "- `app` directory: stores the files that generate the events, dictate business logic, and write to sqllite tables.\n",
    "    - `game_api.py`: stores business logic for various types of actions (discussed below).\n",
    "    - `models.py`: write event data to sqllite tables.\n",
    "    - `events.py`: py script to generate a stream of random events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Components:\n",
    "- flask app: server that runs the game.\n",
    "- kafka topic: there is a single Kafka topic, `events` used in this data pipeline. From this topic, the various event types are filtered and written to hive tables using separate, action-specific spark streams.\n",
    "    - Kafka observer creation: docker-compose exec mids kafkacat -C -b kafka:29092 -t events -o beginning\n",
    "- sqllite tables: there are five tables that are created and used to store the data generated by the game API for reference for some light business logic application.\n",
    "    - swords\n",
    "    - transactions\n",
    "    - guilds\n",
    "    - players\n",
    "    - guild_interactions\n",
    "- spark jobs: there are action-specific spark jobs that filter the events into their respective hive tables.\n",
    "- hdfs parquet files: these parquet files are written by the spark jobs to their respective hive directories:\n",
    "    - /tmp/add_sword\n",
    "    - /tmp/purchase_sword\n",
    "    - /tmp/add_guild\n",
    "    - /tmp/add_player\n",
    "    - /tmp/join_guild\n",
    "- hive tables: there are five, action specific hive tables that are created for querying by Presto:\n",

    "## Game API Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group decided to expand on the initial project prompt by adding to the available actions within the game API and the data that would be generated with each transaction. In addition to the 'buy sword' action, we added 'add player', 'add guild', 'join guild', and 'add sword'. We felt that this would be an appropriate level of complexity to test our data pipeline creation, coding, and querying skills. As you will observe within the code, a few of these actions may also have additional parameters that need to be specified upon creation that we felt made sense to, given a standard understanding of typical game dynamics. These actions may also return additional data, such as data about interactions between players, between players and objects, as well as temporal data, providing us with a rich dataset from which we would then flex our Presto querying skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noteworthy implications of this added complexity that we would like to highlight are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base event data written to the final hive tables are captured in a single string that is then parsed using regex, depending on the analytics question. See Basic Event Analysis section below.\n",
    "- Creation of sqllite.db file, which allows for simulating realistic in-game events in a persistent game world from the flask app."

    "## Basic Event Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate events manually. Depending on the action, there may be parameters that will need to be defined. Examples of how to run each action from the terminal are provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- add a guild: docker-compose exec mids curl \"http://localhost:5000/add_guild?name=jokers\"\n",
    "- add a player: docker-compose exec mids curl \"http://localhost:5000/add_playter?name=batman?money=999999\"\n",

    "- add a sword: docker-compose exec mids curl \"http://localhost:5000/add_sword?cost=100\"\n",
    "- buy a sword: docker-compose exec mids curl \"http://localhost:5000/purchase_sword?buyer_id=1&sword_id=1\"\n",

    "\n",
    "- The logic of these queries (especially those dealing with transaction data) may not robustly account for faulty business logic. The group felt that the proper place to enforce business logic would be further upstream in the application pipeline (not in the queries), and that the vast majority of this sort of robustness was outside the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because of how the event data are captured in the expanded game, some initial regex will need to be performed in order to isolate the paramters of interest. The group felt that it was beyond the scope of this project to create custom tables to service each of the numberous types of business questions that we could potentially explore.\n",
